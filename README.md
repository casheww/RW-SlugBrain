# RW-SlugBrain
WIP BepInEx plugin for Rain World that aims to automate slugcat. Not a TAS tool because I expect it to be really bad.


## Issues & TODOs
- can't see food not "accessible"
- can't get off the top of bottom of vertical poles
- sometimes gets stuck on slopes??
- no threat tracking
- no advanced jumping (pounces, etc.)
- can't hunt for food - basically vegan... except froot may be bugs?!
