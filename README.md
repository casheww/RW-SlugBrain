# RW-SlugBrain
WIP BepInEx plugin for Rain World that aims to automate slugcat. Not a TAS tool because I expect it to be really bad.


## Current state

- custom pathfinding implemented
- need to give the pathfinder an understanding of gravity and climbability
- need to re-implement jump trajectory calculation
- need to add threat tracking
