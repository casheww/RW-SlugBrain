# RW-SlugBrain
WIP BepInEx plugin for Rain World that aims to automate slugcat. Not a TAS tool because I expect it to be really bad.


## Issues and TODOs
- [ ] play with path finding to account for jump estimates
- [x] do food tracking
- [x] slugcat can't get off the bottom of vertical poles
- [ ] sometimes gets stuck on slopes??
- [ ] no threat tracking
- [ ] no advanced jumping (pounces, etc.)
